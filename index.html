			<p>Despite what you may have heard, Pheonix isn't that awesome of a city. There are a lot of different why this city sucks, but these are the most important ones. First of all, there's barely any water! Who wants to live in a city where there's always a drought? Second, it's hot. Like, all the time. So, if you love sweating through your clothes, come on down! Finally, last but NOT least, we have an abundance of cacti. Cacti are cool and fun from afar, sure. But in Phoenix the cacti aren't just a pretty picture anymore, they're on your streets, in your yards, and if you're not careful, in your skin. We have jumping cacti that live up to their name and really attack you.</p>
